## Project Dataset
- We will be using 1 minute tick data for S&P 500 from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/gratefuldata/intraday-stock-data-1-min-sp-500-200821). The data is from 22 January 2008 to 6 May 2021. This dataset hence covers the financial crisis and the market evolution after it as well as the recent Covid crisis. We believe that covering the crisis period will help us uncover questions about the volatility during turbulent times as well as normal times.
