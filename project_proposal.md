## Project Dataset
- We will be using 1 minute tick data for S&P 500 from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/gratefuldata/intraday-stock-data-1-min-sp-500-200821). The data is from 22 January 2008 to 6 May 2021. This dataset hence covers the financial crisis, the European sovereign debt crisis, several rounds of dispute about the U.S. debt ceiling, and the flash crashes of 6 May 2010 and 24 August 2015, the recent Covid crisis in 2020 and the market evolution after it. We believe that covering the crisis period will help us uncover questions about the volatility during turbulent times as well as normal time. Computation of time serios of realised variance will be done at weekly as well as daily level so as to catch any signals which might get missed during the computation of daily realised variance.
