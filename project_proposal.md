## Project Dataset
- We will be using 1 minute tick data for S&P 500 from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/gratefuldata/intraday-stock-data-1-min-sp-500-200821). The data is from 22 January 2008 to 6 May 2021. This dataset hence covers the financial crisis of 2008 to 2009, the European sovereign debt crisis, Greece brankruptcy, several rounds of dispute about the U.S. debt ceiling, and the flash crashes of 6 May 2010 and 24 August 2015 as well as the recent Covid crisis in 2020 and the market evolution after it.Computation of time serios of realised variance will be done at weekly as well as daily level so as to catch any signals which might get missed during the computation of daily realised variance.
- The input features we will be exploring are 



## Importance of the Question
 We believe that covering the crisis period will help us uncover questions about the volatility during turbulent times as well as normal time. 

## Reasons Why We Will Achieve the Goal
On the one hand, the structure of financial markets is complex, highly nonlinear and has a low signal-to-noise ratio, which makes it nearly impossible to predict short-term asset returns (see, e.g., Gu, Kelly, and Xiu, 2020; Chen, Pelger, and Zhu, 2019). On the other hand, various stylized facts (e.g., the slow decay of autocorrelation in absolute returns), implies that volatility is to a large extent predictable. With its crucial role in asset pricing, portfolio allocation, and risk management, volatility forecasting has therefore attracted a large amount of attention
